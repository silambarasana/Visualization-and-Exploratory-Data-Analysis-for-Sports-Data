## Visualization-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for-Sports-Data
### Domain: Sports
- Context:
 - Lets consider a National Hockey League (NHL) data for exploratory data analysis.
 - It is widely accepted among NHL fans that NHL players who rack up higher numbers in categories like shots, games played, and time-on-ice are more likely to score a higher 
   number of goals and assists in a season. This report explores these assumptions by analyzing 20 seasons of NHL statistics.
 - The data contains categories, and the population represented is every NHL player from 1999-2018.
 - The categories for analysis include a playerâ€™s position, goals, assists, points, shots, games played, time-on-ice, blocks, and hits.
 - More specifically, each category was analyzed to discover how they correlate with higher goals and assists scored in a season, and which position typically earns the most goals, assists, blocks, and hits per season.
- Objective:
   - Visualization plays a major role in performing EDA. In this project we will focus on visualization, different plots and their interpretation. 
- EDA can be performed using:
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis
  - Multivariate Analysis
